# Treehouse-Project-1
Project One- Build a random quote generator 

Hi and thanks for taking the time.

Also big thanks to TeamTreehouse your set up is Great and has really helped me on my way.

The most current Js file will be index.js any others in this repo will be files that are to prove my work throughs (and so I don't forget where I'm up to!!!).

PROJECT ONE 
This project is where I have attempted to make a "random quote generator" using an array of objects.
When the button is clicked the page will load another quote from the array of quotes.
The page also changes colour on click and after a certain time period (7.5secs).
Again whilst the page changes to a random colour there will also be a new quote appear.

I have tried to add an extra little something with tooltip mark up where by on mouse over of the quote the tooltip like popup will show when the quote was said in the film.

THEME:
I have chosen to use the "Back To The Future Films" as a theme. I would like to acnowledge that alot of the quotes I have used are in fact used by different characters at multiple different times during the films. I understand that accuracy is a good thing but for me this was an exercise in getting the code right. I hope that anyone actually using the quote genrator bears this in mind and the quote generator brings back fond memories of the brilliant films!
I would also like to acnowledge that some of the date information isn't correct I hope this can be taken as an irony of the theme of the films.
